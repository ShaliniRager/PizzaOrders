#Python Coding
a)Pizza orders are in queue
Need to segregate the meat pizzas from Veg Pizza
Veg is determined by +
Meat is determined by -

Print Out the First Meat pizza is order queue of 3
N = Total number of orders
Size - Subset

b)Array challenge
Count the number of differences in two strings

c)Abstract Classes
Given a Book class and a Solution class, write a MyBook class that does the following:
Inherits from Book
Has a parameterized constructor taking these  parameters

d)Exceptions:
d1)Read a string, S, and print its integer value ; if S  cannot be converted to an integer, print Bad String
Cannot use loop/Conditional statements

d2)
Write a Calculator class with a single method: int power(int,int). The power method takes two integers,n  and p , as parameters and returns the integer result of n to the power p. If either n or p is negative, then the method must throw an exception with the message: n and p should be non-negative.
Can use loop/conditional

e)Inptu a string and have methods using stack and queue toi insert and remove the characters
print out whether dequeued character and popped char from stack says that it is a palindrome
f)The NumPy module also comes with a number of built-in routines for linear algebra calculations. These can be found in the sub-module linalg.
linalg.det

The linalg.det tool computes the determinant of an array.
